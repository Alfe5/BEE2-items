		"Line"		"Reflection Gel is a cut gel that was going to be released with the Peer Review update."
		"Invert"	"NEVER change the Paint Type property, this can crash the game!"
		"Bullet"	"Lasers aimed at it reflect off it like a mirror."
		"Bullet"	"It is slightly sticky, counteracting Propulsion Gel."
		"Bullet"	"It appears silvery-grey when falling, the same as conversion gel when on the ground (not usually noticeable unless both are in the same map) and like propulsion gel on light bridges and when splashed on your face."
